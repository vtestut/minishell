# minishell

Welcome to my `minishell` project !  

This is a major project in the Ecole 42 commom core, and it's a tough one !  
It challenges students to create a not so simple Unix shell.  

Read the [subject](https://github.com/VirgileT/minishell-42/blob/main/SUBJECT_minishell.pdf).

## Project Overview

The `minishell` project is an introduction to operating systems and process management. Key features include:

- **Command Execution:**
  - Implement the execution of basic shell commands.
  - Implement our own versions of built-in commands (cd, echo, export, unset, exit, pwd, env)

- **Redirection and Pipes:**
  - Support input/output redirection and pipes.

- **Environment Variables:**
  - Manage and modify environment variables.

- **Signals:**
  - Handle signals such as Ctrl+C and Ctrl+D.

## Contents

- **`/srcs/`:** Contains the source files, including the main `minishell` program.
- **`/include/`:** Header files, including `minishell.h`.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `/srcs/` directory and review the source files.
3. Compile the project using the provided Makefile (`make`).
4. Run the executable to start the `minishell` (`./minishell`).

## Features

- **Simple Commands:**
  - Execute basic shell commands.

- **Redirection:**
  - Redirect input and output using `<` and `>`.

- **Pipes:**
  - Use pipes (`|`) to connect multiple commands.

- **Environment Variables:**

- **Signals:**
  - Handle signals such as Ctrl+C and Ctrl+D gracefully.
